> **General disclaimer:** Please be aware that this template is in private preview. Therefore, expect smaller bugs and issues when working with the solution. Please submit an Issue in GitHub if you come across any issues that you would like us to fix.

## Description

The Data Management template is, as the name suggests, classified as a management function and is at the heart of the [**Enterprise Scale Analytics an AI**](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale-Analytics) platform. It is responsible for the governance of the platform and enables communication to ingest data sources from Azure, third-party clouds and on-premises data sources.

## What will be deployed?

By default, all the services which come under Data Management Zone are enabled, and you must explicitly disable services that you don't want to be deployed.

> **Note:** Before deploying the resources, we recommend to check registration status of the required resource providers in your subscription. For more information, see [Resource providers for Azure services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types).

You have two options for deploying this reference architecture:

1. Use the `Deploy to Azure` button for an immediate deployment
2. Use GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps Pipelines for an automated, repeatable deployment

## Prerequisites

The following prerequisites are required to make this repository work:

- an Azure subscription
- [User Access Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) access to the subscription to be able to create a service principal and role assignments for it.

If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, [create your Azure free account today](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

## Option 1: Deploy to Azure - Quickstart

| Data Management Zone |
|:---------------------|
[![Deploy to Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fdata-management-zone%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fdeploy.dataHub.json)

## Option 2: GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps Pipelines

### 1. Create repository from a template

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of this repository.
1. Above the file list, click **Use this template**
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/UseThisTemplateGH.png" alt="GitHub Template repository" width="600"/>
</p>

3. Use the **Owner** drop-down menu and select the account you want to own the repository.
<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/CreateRepoGH.png" alt="Create Repository from Template" width="600"/>
</p>

4. Type a name for your repository and an optional description.
1. Choose a repository visibility. For more information, see "[About repository visibility](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/about-repository-visibility)."
1. Optionally, to include the directory structure and files from all branches in the template and not just the default branch, select **Include all branches**.
1. Click **Create repository from template**.

### 2. Setting up the required Service Principal and access

A service principal needs to be generated for authentication and authorization from GitHub or Azure DevOps to your Azure subscription. This is required to deploy resources to your environment. Just go to the Azure Portal to find the ID of your subscription. Then start the Cloud Shell or Azure CLI, login to Azure, set the Azure context and execute the following commands to generate the required credentials:

### Azure CLI

```Shell
# Replace {service-principal-name} and {subscription-id} with your 
# Azure subscription id and any name for your service principal.
az ad sp create-for-rbac \
  --name "{service-principal-name}" \
  --role "Contributor" \
  --scopes "/subscriptions/{subscription-id}" \
  --sdk-auth
```

This will generate the following JSON output:

```JSON
{
  "clientId": "<GUID>",
  "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
  "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
  "tenantId": "<GUID>",
  (...)
}
```

>**Note:** Take note of the output. It will be required for the next steps.

Now that you have set up the Service Principal, you need to choose how would you like to deploy the resources.
Deployment options:

1. [GitHub Actions]()
1. [Azure DevOps]()

## GitHub Actions

If you want to use GitHub Actions for deploying the resources, add the previous JSON output as a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) with the name `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in your GitHub repository:
    <p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/AzureCredentialsGH.png" alt="GitHub Secrets" width="600"/>
    </p>

To do so, execute the following steps:

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click on the **Settings** tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets**.
4. Click **New repository secret**.
5. Type the name `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` for your secret in the Name input box.
6. Enter the JSON output from above as value for your secret.
7. Click **Add secret**.

##Azure DevOps

If you want to use Azure DevOps Pipelines for deploying the resources, you need to create an Azure Resource Manager service connection. To do so, execute the following steps:

1. First, you need to create an Azure DevOps Project. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page).
1. In Azure DevOps, open the **Project settings**.
1. Now, select the **Service connections** page from the project settings page.
1. Choose **New service connection** and select **Azure Resource Manager**.
      <p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/ARMConnectionDevOps.png" alt="ARM Connection" width="600"/>
     </p>

5. On the next page select **Service principal (manual)**.
6. Select the appropriate environment to which you would like to deploy the templates. Only the default option **Azure Cloud** is currently supported.
7. For the **Scope Level**, select **Subscription** and enter your `subscription Id` and `name`.
8. Enter the details of the service principal that we have generated in step 3. (**Service Principal Id** = **clientId**, **Service Principal Key** = **clientSecret**, **Tenant ID** = **tenantId**) and click on **Verify** to make sure that the connection works.
9. Enter a user-friendly **Connection name** to use when referring to this service connection. Take note of the name because this will be required in the parameter update process.
10. Optionally, enter a **Description**.
11. Click on **Verify and save**.

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/images/ConnectionDevOps.png" alt="Connection DevOps" width="300"/>
    </p>

More information can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure?view=azure-devops#create-an-azure-resource-manager-service-connection-with-an-existing-service-principal).

## 3. Parameter Update Process

In order to deploy the ARM templates in this repository to the desired Azure subscription, you will need to modify some parameters in the forked repository. As updating each parameter file manually is a time-consuming and potentially error-prone process, we have simplified the task with a GitHub Action workflow. After successfully executing the previous steps, please open the  [.github/workflows/updateParameters.yml](/.github/workflows/updateParameters.yml). In this file you need to update the environment variables. Just click on [.github/workflows/updateParameters.yml](/.github/workflows/updateParameters.yml) and edit the following section:

```YAML
env:
  DATA_HUB_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: '{dataHubSubscriptionId}'
  DATA_HUB_NAME: '{dataHubName}' # Choose max. 11 characters. They will be used as a prefix for all services. If not unique, deployment can fail for some services.
  LOCATION: '{regionName}'       # Specifies the region for all services (e.g. 'northeurope', 'eastus', etc.)
  AZURE_RESOURCE_MANAGER_CONNECTION_NAME: '{resourceManagerConnectionName}'
```

The following table explains each of the parameters:

| Parameter                                | Description  | Sample value |
|:-----------------------------------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| **DATA_HUB_SUBSCRIPTION_ID**             | Specifies the subscription ID of the Data Management Zone where all the resources will be deployed &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; | `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |
| **DATA_HUB_NAME**        | Specifies the name of your Data Management Zone. The value should consist of alphanumeric characters (A-Z, a-z, 0-9) and should not contain any special characters like `-`, `_`, `.`, etc. Special characters will be removed in the renaming process. | `myhub01` |
| **LOCATION**                                 | Specifies the region where you want the resources to be deployed. | `northeurope` |
| **AZURE_RESOURCE_MANAGER _CONNECTION_NAME**   | Specifies the resource manager connection name in Azure DevOps. You can leave the default value if you want to use GitHub Actions for your deployment. More details on how to create the resource manager connection in Azure DevOps can be found in step 4. b) or [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/pipelines/library/connect-to-azure?view=azure-devops#create-an-azure-resource-manager-service-connection-with-an-existing-service-principal). | `my-connection-name` |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

After updating the values, please commit the updated version to the `main` branch of your repository. This will kick off a GitHub Action workflow, which will appear under the **Actions** tab of the main page of the repository. The `Update Parameter Files` workflow will update all parameters in your repository according to a pre-defined naming convention. Once the process has finished, it will open a new pull request in your repository, where you can review the changes made by the workflow. Please follow the instructions in the pull request to complete the parameter update process. It will guide you to change the environment variables in the deployment workflow file as well.

>**Note:** We are not renaming the environment variables in the workflow files because this could lead to an infinite loop of workflow runs being started.

After following the instructions in the pull request, you can merge the pull request back into the `main` branch of your repository by clicking on **Merge pull request**. Finally, you can click on **Delete branch** to clean up your repository.

## 4. Reference pipeline from GitHub repository in Azure DevOps Pipelines

## Known issues

### Error: MissingSubscriptionRegistration

**Error Message:**

```sh
ERROR: Deployment failed. Correlation ID: ***
  "error": ***
    "code": "MissingSubscriptionRegistration",
    "message": "The subscription is not registered to use namespace 'Microsoft.DocumentDB'. See https://aka.ms/rps-not-found for how to register subscriptions.",
    "details": [
      ***
        "code": "MissingSubscriptionRegistration",
        "target": "Microsoft.DocumentDB",
        "message": "The subscription is not registered to use namespace 'Microsoft.DocumentDB'. See https://aka.ms/rps-not-found for how to register subscriptions."
 
```

**Solution:**

This error message appears, in case during the deployment it tries to create a type of resource which has never been deployed before inside the subscription. We recommend to check prior the deployment whether the required resource providers are registered for your subscription and if needed, register them through the `Azure Portal`, `Azure Powershell` or `Azure CLI` as mentioned [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types).
