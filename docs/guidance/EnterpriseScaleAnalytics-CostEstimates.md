# Cost Estimates

This document will provide users an overview of what monthly cost can be expected when using Enterprise-Scale Analytics. Links to the official Cost Calculator will be provided where users can make changes depending on the expected amount of data and data throughput. All cost calculations will specify base cost of Enterprise-Scale Analytics. Base cost means the cost that occur if no data workloads run inside the respective subscriptions.

## Data Management Zone

In a production scenario, it is recommended to rely on the Azure Firewall and Private DNS Zones hosted in the connectivity Hub of [Enterprise-Scale Landing Zones](https://github.com/Azure/Enterprise-Scale). In MVPs, users may rely on the Azure Firewall and Private DNS Zones bundled with Enterprise-Scale Analytics. Hence, two different cost calclations are provided which can be found below:

- [Pricing Calculator - Data Management Zone w/o Azure Firewall and Private DNS Zones](https://azure.com/e/ebb7508a6d78487b9a1583878d0948cc)
- [Pricing Calculator - Data Management Zone w/ Azure Firewall and Private DNS Zones](https://azure.com/e/658478643d4b46fdbf8b1972c4b0704b)

Please keep in mind that the following services are not listed in the overview, because they are either not available in the official Pricing Calculator or the Pricing Calculator does not allow to set the compute hours to 0:

| Service Name             | Additional Cost |
|:------------------------:|:---------------:|
| Azure Purview            | ~$300.03/month  |
| Synapse Private Link Hub |   ~$7.50/month  |
| Route Table              |    $0.00/month  |
| Network Security Group   |    $0.00/month  |

## Data Landing Zone

For the Data Landing Zone, please refer to the following cost calculation:

Cost can be further reduced by hosting the Self-hosted Integration Runtime (SHIR) on-premises instead of hosting it on a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS).

Please keep in mind that the following services are not listed in the overview, because they are either not available in the official Pricing Calculator or the Pricing Calculator does not allow to set the compute hours to 0:

| Service Name             | Additional Cost |
|:------------------------:|:---------------:|
| Azure Databricks         | $0.00/month     |
| Route Table              | $0.00/month     |
| Network Security Group   | $0.00/month     |
