The Enterprise-Scale reference architecture is secure by design and uses a multi-layered security approach to overcome common data exfiltration risks raised by customers. Features on a network, identity, data and service layer, enable customers to define granular access controls to only expose required data to a user. Even if some of these security mechanisms fail, data within the ESA platform stays secure.
