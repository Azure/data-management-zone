# Deploy reference implementation using GitHub Actions

## 1. Resource deployment

If you want to use GitHub Actions for deploying the resources, add the previous JSON output as a [repository secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#creating-encrypted-secrets-for-a-repository) with the name `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` in your GitHub repository:

To do so, execute the following steps:

1. On GitHub, navigate to the main page of the repository.
2. Under your repository name, click on the **Settings** tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click **Secrets**.
4. Click **New repository secret**.
5. Type the name `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` for your secret in the Name input box.
6. Enter the JSON output from above as value for your secret.
7. Click **Add secret**.

## 2. Parameter Updates

In order to deploy the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates to the desired Azure subscription, you will need to modify some parameters in the forked repository. Therefore, **this step should not be skipped**. There are two files that require updates:

- `.github/workflows/dataManagementZoneDeployment.yml` and
- `infra/params.dev.json`

Update these files in a separate branch and then merge via Pull Request to trigger the initial deployment.

### 2.1. Configure `dataManagementZoneDeployment.yml`

To begin, please open the [.github/workflows/dataManagementZoneDeployment.yml](/.github/workflows/dataManagementZoneDeployment.yml). In this file you need to update the environment variables section. Just click on [.github/workflows/dataManagementZoneDeployment.yml](/.github/workflows/dataManagementZoneDeployment.yml) and edit the following section:

```yaml
env:
  AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: "17588eb2-2943-461a-ab3f-00a3ceac3112" # Update to '{dataHubSubscriptionId}'
  AZURE_LOCATION: "northeurope"                                 # Update to '{regionName}'
```

The following table explains each of the parameters:

| Parameter                                | Description  | Sample value |
|:-----------------------------------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| **AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID**             | Specifies the subscription ID of the Data Management Zone where all the resources will be deployed | <div style="width: 36ch">`xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`</div> |
| **AZURE_LOCATION**                                 | Specifies the region where you want the resources to be deployed. Please check [Supported Regions](#supported-regions)  | `northeurope` |
| **AZURE_RESOURCE_MANAGER _CONNECTION_NAME**   | Specifies the resource manager connection name in Azure DevOps. You can leave the default value if you want to use GitHub Actions for your deployment. | `my-connection-name` |

### 2.2. Configure `params.dev.json`

To begin, please open the [infra/params.dev.json](/infra/params.dev.json). In this file you need to update the variable values. Just click on [infra/params.dev.json](/infra/params.dev.json) and edit the values. An explanation of the values is given in the table below:

| Parameter                                | Description  | Sample value |
|:-----------------------------------------|:-------------|:-------------|
| location | Specifies the location for all resources. | `northeurope` |
| environment | Specifies the environment of the deployment. | `dev`, `tst` or `prd` |
| prefix | Specifies the prefix for all resources created in this deployment. | `prefi` |
| vnetAddressPrefix | Specifies the address space of the vnet. | `10.0.0.0/16` |
| azureFirewallSubnetAddressPrefix | Specifies the address space of the subnet that is use for Azure Firewall. | `10.0.0.0/24` |
| servicesSubnetAddressPrefix | Specifies the address space of the subnet that is used for the services. | `10.0.1.0/24` |
| firewallPrivateIp | Specifies the private IP address of the central firewall. | `10.0.0.4` |
| dnsServerAdresses | Specifies the private IP addresses of the DNS servers. | [ `10.0.0.4` ] |

### 3. Merge these changes back to the `main` branch of your repo

After following the instructions and updating the parameters and variables in your repository in a separate branch and opening the pull request, you can merge the pull request back into the `main` branch of your repository by clicking on **Merge pull request**. Finally, you can click on **Delete branch** to clean up your repository. By doing this, you trigger the deployment workflow.

### 4. Follow the workflow deployment

**Congratulations!** You have successfully executed all steps to deploy the template into your environment through GitHub Actions.

You can navigate to the **Actions** tab of the main page of the repository, where you will see a workflow with the name `Data Management Zone Deployment` running. Click on it to see how it deploys the environment. If you run into any issues, please open an issue [here](https://github.com/Azure/data-management-zone/issues).
