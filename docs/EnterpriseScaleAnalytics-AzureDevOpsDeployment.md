# Data Management Zone - Azure DevOps Deployment

In the previous step we have generated a JSON output similar to the following, which will be required in the next steps:

```json
{
  "clientId": "<GUID>",
  "clientSecret": "<GUID>",
  "subscriptionId": "<GUID>",
  "tenantId": "<GUID>",
  (...)
}
```

## Create Service Connection

First, you need to create an Azure Resource Manager service connection. To do so, execute the following steps:

1. First, you need to create an Azure DevOps Project. Instructions can be found [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project?view=azure-devops&tabs=preview-page).
1. In Azure DevOps, open the **Project settings**.
1. Now, select the **Service connections** page from the project settings page.
1. Choose **New service connection** and select **Azure Resource Manager**.

   ![ARM Connection](/docs/images/ARMConnectionDevOps.png)

1. On the next page select **Service principal (manual)**.
1. Select the appropriate environment to which you would like to deploy the templates. Only the default option **Azure Cloud** is currently supported.
1. For the **Scope Level**, select **Subscription** and enter your `subscription Id` and `name`.
1. Enter the details of the service principal that we have generated in step 3. (**Service Principal ID** = **clientId**, **Service Principal Key** = **clientSecret**, **Tenant ID** = **tenantId**) and click on **Verify** to make sure that the connection works.
1. Enter a user-friendly **Connection name** to use when referring to this service connection. Take note of the name because this will be required in the parameter update process.
1. Optionally, enter a **Description**.
1. Click on **Verify and save**.

## Update Parameters

In order to deploy the Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates to the desired Azure subscription, you will need to modify some parameters in the forked repository. Therefore, **this step should not be skipped for neither Azure DevOps/GitHub options**. There are two files that require updates:

- `.ado/workflows/dataManagementZoneDeployment.yml` and
- `infra/params.dev.json`.

Update these files in a seperate branch and then merge via Pull Request to trigger the initial deployment.

### Configure `dataManagementZoneDeployment.yml`

To begin, please open the [.ado/workflows/dataManagementZoneDeployment.yml](/.ado/workflows/dataManagementZoneDeployment.yml). In this file you need to update the variables section. Just click on [.ado/workflows/dataManagementZoneDeployment.yml](/.ado/workflows/dataManagementZoneDeployment.yml) and edit the following section:

```yaml
variables:
  AZURE_RESOURCE_MANAGER_CONNECTION_NAME: "data-management-zone-service-connection" # Update to '{yourResourceManagerConnectionName}'
  AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID: "17588eb2-2943-461a-ab3f-00a3ceac3112"                     # Update to '{yourDataManagementZoneSubscriptionId}'
  AZURE_LOCATION: "North Europe"                                                    # Update to '{yourRegionName}'
```

The following table explains each of the parameters:

### Install Azure DevOps Pipelines GitHub Application

First you need to add and install the Azure Pipelines GitHub App to your GitHub account. To do so, execute the following steps:

1. Click on **Marketplace** in the top navigation bar on GitHub.
1. In the Marketplace, search for **Azure Pipelines**. The Azure Pipelines offering is free for anyone to use for public repositories and free for a single build queue if you're using a private repository.

    ![Install Azure Pipelines on GitHub](/docs/images/AzurePipelinesGH.png)

1. Select it and click on **Install it for free**.

    ![GitHub Template repository](/docs/images/InstallButtonGH.png)

1. If you are part of multiple **GitHub** organizations, you may need to use the **Switch billing account** dropdown to select the one into which you forked this repository.
1. You may be prompted to confirm your GitHub password to continue.
1. You may be prompted to log in to your Microsoft account. Make sure you log in with the one that is associated with your Azure DevOps account.

### Configuring the Azure Pipelines project

As a last step, you need to create an Azure DevOps pipeline in your project based on the pipeline definition YAML file that is stored in your GitHub repository. To do so, execute the following steps:

1. Select the Azure DevOps project where you have setup your `Resource Manager Connection`.
1. Select **Pipelines** and then **New Pipeline** in order to create a new pipeline.

    ![Create Pipeline in DevOps](/docs/images/CreatePipelineDevOps.png)

1. Choose **GitHub YAML** and search for your repository (e.g. "`GitHubUserName/RepositoryName`").

    ![Choose code source in DevOps Pipeline](/docs/images/CodeDevOps.png)

1. Select your repository.
1. Click on **Existing Azure Pipelines in YAML file**
1. Select `main` as branch and `/.ado/workflows/dataHubDeployment.yml` as path.

    ![Configure Pipeline in DevOps](/docs/images/ConfigurePipelineDevOps.png)

1. Click on **Continue** and then on **Run**.

## Merge these changes back to the `main` branch of your repository

After following the instructions and updating the parameters and variables in your repository in a separate branch and opening the pull request, you can merge the pull request back into the `main` branch of your repository by clicking on **Merge pull request**. Finally, you can click on **Delete branch** to clean up your repository. By doing this, you trigger the deployment workflow.

## Follow the workflow deployment

**Congratulations!** You have successfully executed all steps to deploy the template into your environment through Azure DevOps.

Now, you can navigate to the pipeline that you have created as part of step 5 and monitor it as each service is deployed. If you run into any issues, please check the [Known Issues](/docs/EnterpriseScaleAnalytics-KnownIssues.md) first and open an [issue](https://github.com/Azure/data-management-zone/issues) if you come accross a potential bug in the repository.

## Add Root Collection Administrator role to Purview account

Since the Purview account is being deployed using a Service Principal, at this point, the only identity that has access to the Purview data plane, is the Service Principal. Use the [instructions in this guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/purview/tutorial-metadata-policy-collections-apis#add-the-root-collection-administrator-role) to assign additional user accounts to the Purview Root Collection as Collection Admin.
