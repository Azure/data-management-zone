# Data Management Zone - Prerequisites

This template repsitory contains all templates to deploy the Data Management Zone of the Enterprise-Scale Analytics architecture. The Data Management Zone is the central management instance to govern all data assets across all Data Landing Zones and possible even beyond that.

## What will be deployed?

By navigating through the deployment steps, you will deploy the following setup in a subscription:

> **Note:** Before deploying the resources, we recommend to check registration status of the required resource providers in your subscription. For more information, see [Resource providers for Azure services](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types).

| `.github/workflows`           | Folder for GitHub workflows. The `dataManagementZoneDeployment.yml` workflow shows the steps for an end-to-end deployment of the architecture. |
| `code`                        | Sample password generation script that will be run in the deployment workflow for resources that require a password during the deployment. |
| `docs`                        | Resources for this README.                 |
| `infra`                       | Folder containing all the Bicep and ARM templates for each of the resources that will be deployed. |

## Supported Regions

For now, we are recommending to select one of the regions mentioned below. The list of regions is limited for now due to the fact that not all services and features are available in all regions. This is mostly related to the fact that we are recommending to leverage at least the zone-redundant storage replication option for all your central Data Lakes in the Data Landing Zones. Since zone-redundant storage is not available in all regions, we are limiting the regions in the Deploy to Azure experience. If you are planning to deploy the Data Management Zone and Data Landing Zone to a region that is not listed below, then please change the setting in the corresponding bicep files in this repository. Officially supported regions are:

- (Africa) South Africa North
- (Asia Pacific) Southeast Asia
- (Asia Pacific) Australia East
- (Asia Pacific) Japan East (*)
- (Canada) Canada Central
- (Europe) North Europe
- (Europe) West Europe
- (Europe) France Central (*)
- (Europe) Germany West Central (*)
- (Europe) UK South
- (South America) Brazil South
- (US) Central US (*)
- (US) East US
- (US) East US 2
- (US) South Central US
- (US) West US 2

(*) *When the regions currently not supporting Azure Purview gets selected, the Azure Purview deployment gets performed on the default region  (Europe) North Europe*.

## Prerequisites

Before we start with the deployment, please make sure that you have the following available:

- An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create your Azure free account today](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
- [User Access Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) or [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner) access to the subscription to be able to create a service principal and role assignments for it.
- For the deployment, please choose one of the **Supported Regions**.

## Deployment

Now you have two options for the deployment of the Data Management Zone:

1. Deploy to Azure Button
2. GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps Pipelines

To use the Deploy to Azure Button, please click on the button below:

| Reference implementation   | Description | Deploy to Azure |
|:---------------------------|:------------|:----------------|
| Enterprise-Scale Analytics | Deploys a Data Management Zone and one or multiple [Data Landing Zone](https://github.com/Azure/data-landing-zone) all at once. Provides less options than the the individual Data Management Zone and Data Landing Zone deployment options. Helps you to quickly get started and make yourself familiar with the reference design. For more advanced scenarios, please deploy the artifacts individually. |[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CreateUIDef/CustomDeploymentBlade/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fdata-management-zone%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Freference%2FenterpriseScaleAnalytics.json/uiFormDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fdata-management-zone%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fportal.enterpriseScaleAnalytics.json) |
| Data Management Zone       | Deploys a single Data Management Zone to a subscription. |[![Deploy To Azure](https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton)](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_CreateUIDef/CustomDeploymentBlade/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fdata-management-zone%2Fmain%2Finfra%2Fmain.json/uiFormDefinitionUri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fdata-management-zone%2Fmain%2Fdocs%2Freference%2Fportal.dataManagementZone.json) |

Alternatively, click on `Next` to follow the steps required to successfully deploy the Data Management Zone through GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps.
